# Decision Tree : Divide and Conquer Method  

Decision learners are powerful classifiers,it uses tree structure to model the relationship.It starts with a **root node**, where it is passed through the **decision nodes**, where the decisions are made based on the condition provided at that instance.These choices split the data across branches that indicate potential outcomes of a decision, depicted here as yes or no outcomes, though in some cases there may be more than two possibilities.The tree is terminated by leaf nodes (also known as terminal nodes) that denote the action to be taken as the result of the series of decisions. In the case of a predictive model, the leaf nodes provide the expected result given the series of events in the tree.
