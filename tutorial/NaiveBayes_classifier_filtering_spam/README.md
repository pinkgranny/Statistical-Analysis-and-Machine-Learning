## Naive Bayes Classification:  
  
  Naive Bayes Classifiers are linear classifiers , they are simple but very efficient.The model of Naive Baye's classifier is dependent on 
  Baye's Theorem.It is assumed the dataset is mutually independent. Strong violations of the independence assumptions and 
  non-linear classification problems can lead to very poor performances of naive Bayes classifiers.
