## Concept of Bayesian Methods:  

Bayesian probability theory is rooted in the idea that the estimated likelihood of an event, or a potential outcome, should be based on  the evidence at hand across multiple trials, or opportunities for the event to occur.  

## Understanding Probability:



## Naive Bayes Classification:  
  
  Naive Bayes Classifiers are linear classifiers , they are simple but very efficient.The model of Naive Baye's classifier is dependent on 
  Baye's Theorem.It is assumed the dataset is mutually independent.But strong violations of the independence assumptions and 
  non-linear classification problems can lead to very poor performances of naive Bayes classifiers. Baye's classifier is used mainly in
  text classification.
