## Machine Learning

Machine Learning can be classified into broad categories : *supervised learning*, *unsupervised learning* and *semi-supervised learning*.

**Supervised Learning**

In supervised learning the algorithm learns from the data/ labelled data.The algorithm is taught from data which is labelled, for example in fruit basket data if a fruit is round in shape and its color is red, in the data it is marked as Apple and if a fruit is long curving cylindrical and its greenish yellow it is marked as Banana in training data. From the training dataset the algorithm is aware of the information it is taught. Now when we place a unlabelled new fruit basket/ test dataset, the algorithm applies its previously learned knowledge to identify and categorize the fruits in the new fruit basket. This is a classification problem we were talking about.
Supervised Learning can be used to solve *Classification* and *Regression* problems. Below table lists the name of a classifcation and regression algorithms in Supervised learning.

                               * K-NearestNeighbor(K-NN)                            * Logistic Regression
                               * Support Vector Machine(SVM)                        * Linear Regression
                               * Naive's Bayes Classifier                           
                               * Decision Tree Classification
                               * Random Forest Classification

**Unsupervised Learning**

In unsupervised learning the algorithms are not trained with labelled data, the algorithm acts on information without any prior knowledge.For instance in unsupervised learning problems the algorithm is not taught that a round shaped red object is apple or greenish yellow long cylindrical object is banana. Looking at the features(similarities, patterns, and differences) of the objects, the algorithm identifies the objects. Unsupervised learning is categorised in *Clustering* and *Association* problem. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/supervised-unsupervised-learning/
